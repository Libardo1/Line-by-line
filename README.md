Line-by-line
============

Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing users to run commands in Terminal/iTerm easily with one keyboard shortcut.

Much/most of this code was taken from randy3k's [Enhanced-R](https://github.com/randy3k/Enhanced-R) plugin. Line-by-line works only on OSX, while Enhanced-R is cross-platform, but Line-by-line is not R-specific.  Command-enter sends any line/block of code, in any language, to the Terminal or iTerm, leaving it up to the user to make sure the appropriate REPL is already running in the Terminal.
