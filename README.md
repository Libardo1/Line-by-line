Line-by-line
============

DISCLAIMER: Most of this code was taken from randy3k's [Enhanced-R](https://github.com/randy3k/Enhanced-R) plugin.

Line-by-line is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing users to run commands from Sublime in Terminal/iTerm easily with one keyboard shortcut.  This is an OSX-specific plugin (Enhanced-R suppords OSX, Windows, and Linux), but supports most coding languages that can be run in a REPL in the Terminal (rather than only R).  

`command-enter` sends any line/block of code to the Terminal or iTerm, leaving it up to the user to make sure the appropriate REPL is running in the Terminal before sending the line/block. Typing `LBL: Choose Application` in the Command Palette allows user to switch between Terminal and iTerm.
